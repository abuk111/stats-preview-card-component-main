## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project I trained flexbox with different flex directions, depends on moblie or desktop version.
The trickiest part of this project was adding purple filter on hero image. The best way I found is making a purple background with higher z-index than photography, and make it opacity. To be honest, I am not really delight of result I achieved, maybe is the better way to do this? It is quite different color than challenge template.

### Continued development

I haven't got plans to continue developing of this challenge solution. The only thing that I can improve in future is purple filter on hero img.
